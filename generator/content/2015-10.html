  -
    time: "4:00"
    title: "About the Technology Radar"
    speaker: "Avinash Chugh"

    time: "4:15"
    title: "Introduction to Reactive Architectures"
    speaker: "Rishi Dahiya &amp; Shilpa Singla"
    subtitle: "Reactive architectures are based on a one-way, asynchronous flow of immutable events through a network of independent processes. Learn about how applications/systems based on reactive architectures are built to be scalable and resilient and decrease the coupling between individual processing units."

    title: "Be Quick, Be Nimble"
    speaker: "Rohit Garg"
    subtitle: "Let's take a closer look at this BDD testing framework for Swift and Objective-C programs. It has the same syntactic flavor as RSpec and Jasmine and is easy to set up. Quick comes bundled with Nimble, a matcher framework for tests. It allows for assertion of types and makes it easy to test asynchronous code."

    title: "Threat Modelling - A structured approach to securing your applications"
    speaker: "Samaj Sekhar &amp; Renu Ahlawat"
    subtitle: "Most realize the importance of writing secure software and dealing with user data in a responsible way. Threat Modelling is a set of techniques to help understand and classify potential threats, and then define possible countermeasures to prevent or mitigate their impact. When turned into 'evil user stories', they give teams a manageable and effective approach to making their systems more secure."

    time: "6:30"
    title: "Time series data stores"
    speaker: "Abhishek Kumar"
    subtitle: "Many kinds of analysis require keeping track of multiple factors over a period of time. From application metrics to financial playgrounds, one can correlate changes based on multiple factors over time to either prepare reports or even predict future events. A time series database (TSDB) is especially made for the purpose of handling data indexed by time. This session will cover the basics constituents of a time series database, and what could make for a better one. We also examine the current landscape of solutions available, and how some of the recent start-ups are using these data stores."
