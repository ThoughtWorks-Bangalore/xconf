    title: "From App Dev to Data Engineer - How problem solving techniques differ"
    speaker: "Chandu Kavar"
    subtitle: "Many application developer changed their role to big data engineer. The problem is that they continue using the earlier programming approaches in big data problems, forgetting that they mostly work for silo-computing(single machine/data in MBs). In this session I will explain how to solve the problems which are compute-intensive as well as data-intensive."

    time: "11:15 - 12:15"
    title: "Number Partitioning Using Optimisation"
    speaker: "Swapnil Kumar"
    subtitle: "Partition Problem is a famous class of problems in Number Theory which deals with the task of dividing a set of positive integers into several subsets so that the sums of the numbers in every subset equal each other. There are different variants of the problems which may include optimisation with various constraints. We have taken some interesting approaches to solve such problems while working with one of our customers. The talk will consist of few of the approaches identified, detailing their conceptual and mathematical models."

    title: "Execution engine evolution: MR to Tez"
    speaker: "Kuldeep Mishra, Deepika Kamboj"
    subtitle: "In this session we will talk about traditional MapReduce execution flow and Tez execution flow. Then we will be talking about the advantage of using Tez as an execution engine in Hive and Pig. Lastly the differences between MapReduce and Tez."

    title: "Spark performance tuning"
    speaker: "Shakti Garg, Nisha Kumari"
    subtitle: "This session is about Spark execution engine and it's performance optimization techniques. It will start with a basic introduction of Spark along with YARN at first and then talking how the performance can be optimized by focussing on different job parameters like Resource allocation(executors and memory), Dynamic allocation, Serialization and Shuffle."

    title: "Streaming your data : Options in the wild"
    speaker: "Atif Syed, Palash Chatterjee"
    subtitle: "In this beginner session we take a look at the different types of streaming/queueing tools out there and a very basic overview of the various difference constructs for each of them with examples."
