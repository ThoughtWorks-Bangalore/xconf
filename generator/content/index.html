    title: "Demystifying Functional Programming"
    speaker: "Dhruv Kapur, Priyam Mitra"
    subtitle: "If you feel out of place amongst the growing community of functional wizards, this talk is what you've been looking for. We'll start with what functional programming means to us, chat about the good parts of stateless programming and finally tackle the messy real world with a powerful monad! While we don't think this will turn you into a functional pro, we do hope it'll turn you into a functional enthusiast. Scala just happens to be a medium to deliver the talk and prior experience with it is not necessary."

    title: "Diving into the New Java"
    speaker: "Ravinder Kadiyan"
    subtitle: "With the release of Java 8 and Java 9, Java introduces a lot of features which are very much profound than any other changes in Java history.\nJava 8: Streams and Lambda expressions (Discussion with live demo)\nJava Stream API supports many parallel operations where you just need to express what you want in a more declarative way and java stream library will automatically choose the best low-level execution mechanism. As a result of this, you donâ€™t need to worry about the thread-safety which is highly error-prone. Java Stream API also provides a more concise way to link different operations on the data that will execute on-demand basis. You can resemble this linking to the Unix command line pipes (|) where you take the output of one command as an input to next command (e.g. cat file1 file2 | tr \"[A-Z]\" | sort | tail -5). \nLambda expressions allow you to pass the code to the API popularly know as behavior parameterization or functional style programming. Prior to this, this was done using anonymous classes but lambda expressions are shorter, clearer and less error-prone. These lambda expressions are supported by functional interfaces which are also added in Java 8 only. This behavior parameterization (lambda expressions) also knows as functions in functional programming ecosystem,  can be passed around and combined to produce powerful programming techniques."

    speaker: "Aditya Bhargava, Rahul Garg"
    subtitle: "If you want to know the technology that powers docker, kubernetes, and medium.com, it's the right forum to join. In this talk, we will discuss Go Lang. We will start with introduction/ origin of the language. Go lang's philosophy and its own way of implementing OOPS.\nWe will also talk about major features of language which makes Go Lang as the first choice for writing servers and distributed systems."
