    speaker: "Kiran Chhabra & Minni Arora"
    subtitle: "How many times have you opened an app and stared at a loading screen for minutes, only to be confronted with an unpleasant message, “No internet connection”? or even more frustating is when you fill a long form, only to submit and get a message “Cannot be submitted right now, please try again”. Most mobile applications are simply clients that display data received from a server in real time, losing all functionality without an internet connection. How great would it be, if an app worked regardless of network connectivity?"
