              ”Agile” told you to embrace change. So, you put up card walls,
              wrote stories and had stand ups. Some of you even wrote tests. But
              can the tools that let you embrace change in the past help you
              embrace the kind of change that is coming in the future? What are
              the 5 big changes happening today that most organizations are

                What if test frameworks had a brain of their own? What if you could ask that little brain to ‘click the search button’ for you. What if you could ask the brain to verify a login page? What if automated tests maintain and adapt to application changes by itself after a major UI revamp? What if the brain was able to do all of this out of the box, and worked on applications it has never seen before? This session covers the evolution of element selectors, how appium works with Tensorflow and how it locates elements.

                The data deluge in Internet of Things is making it challenging for existing cloud-based centralised IoT systems to draw actionable insights in near-real-time, though it is critical for businesses to gain competitive edge. This talk discusses in detail how the decentralized approach of ‘Edge Computing’ i.e., moving computation closer to the source of data can address different challenges associated with cloud-based approach.
